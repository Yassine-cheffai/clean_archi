- The clean architecture, for example, pushes abstraction to its limits. One of the main concepts is that you should isolate parts of your system as much as possible, so you can replace them without affecting the rest
- Remember that an architecture tries to detail how a process is implemented at a certain
granularity, given certain assumptions or requirements. The quality of an architecture can then be
judged on the basis of parameters such as its cost, the quality of the outputs, its simplicity or
"elegance", the amount of effort required to change it, and so on
