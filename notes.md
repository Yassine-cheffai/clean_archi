- durability, utility, beauty
- architecture = the art and science in which the components of a computer asystem are organised and integrated
- clean = you know where things are, why components are there, what something is
- if you don't think about architecture, the framework you are using will do it for you, ex: django
- be reasonable; try to understand why a methodology leads to a solution and adopt it if it fits your need
- The clean architecture, for example, pushes abstraction to its limits. One of the main concepts is that you should isolate parts of your system as much as possible, so you can replace them without affecting the rest
- Remember that an architecture tries to detail how a process is implemented at a certain
granularity, given certain assumptions or requirements. The quality of an architecture can then be
judged on the basis of parameters such as its cost, the quality of the outputs, its simplicity or
"elegance", the amount of effort required to change it, and so on
