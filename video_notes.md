- durability, utility, beauty
- architecture = the art and science in which the components of a computer asystem are organised and integrated
- clean = you know where things are, why components are there, what something is
- what ever is in a layer, can not see what is outside
- if you don't think about architecture, the framework you are using will do it for you, ex: django
- be reasonable; try to understand why a methodology leads to a solution and adopt it if it fits your need
- decouple the the web framework from the use case
- one of the main advantages of the clean architecture is that is testable, we can test the components in a isolation
- unit testing: testing the use case
- integration testing: testing the web framework apis/endpoints
